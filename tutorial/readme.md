# Tutorial

These files are the **starting points** for each week. Note that they are not the result of modifying the code from the post each week. 
Each file serves as a starting point for the next week.

You should simply be able to copy and paste each file into a C++11 compiler and should compile and run with no errors. The only week that
should need another compiler is Week 6 and Final, which need C++17 or later compiler.
